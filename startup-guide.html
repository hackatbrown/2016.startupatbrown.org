      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <p><b>What are workshops? Can we host one?</b></p>
      <p>A leader, engineer, or designer teaching a prepared 40-min workshop/talk to 25-35 students with 10 minutes for Q&A at the end.</p>
      <p>The workshops aren't necessarily interactive and they can range from "what is product management" to "what is social entrepreneurship" to tech talks from engineers. They're usually a slideshow.</p>
      <p>Yes! If you're a sponsor and would like to host a workshop, we'd need the following by September 19:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Title of workshop</li>
        <li>Name of person(s) teaching the workshop</li>
        <li>Title of person(s) in the company (lead designer, CTO, co-founder, engineer, etc.)</li>
        <li>Company Represented</li>
      </ol>
      <p>No worries if you can't host a talk, some companies don't. We'll still have "Startup Office Hours" where students can come talk with engineers/representatives from the companies for a more casual free-form conversation. Students get to know the companies more in-depth or talk with some they missed at the startup fair.
      </p>

      <p><b>What size are the tables for the startup fair?</b></p>
      <p>Weâ€™ll have a 6' table prepared for you at the Startup Fair. Please plan to bring along any kind of recruiting materials or decorations you wish for your
      table.</p>
      <p><strong>When will we get the Resume Book?</strong></p>
      <p>We'll send the resume book of 300+ students during the week leading up to the conference.</p>

      <p><b>Recommendations for staying overnight?</b></p>
      <p>If staying overnight in Providence, this is a <a href="http://www.campustravel.com/university/brown/visit_brown.html" target="_blank">list of hotels</a> that offer discount from Brown.</p>
